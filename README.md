# APICongress

Welcome to **APICongress** â€“ a fun, interactive platform where multiple AI debate champions take on a topic of your choice! Each AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and more) will be assigned a unique political persona and will generate lively, debate-style responses. Watch as the discussion unfolds and even cast your vote for the best argument.

## What Is APICongress?

APICongress is a demo application that simulates a political debate by calling on several AI models. Here's how it works:
- **User Input:** You enter a debate topic.
- **AI Assignment:** The system assigns each AI a random political stance.
- **Debate Simulation:** Each AI responds with arguments reflecting its persona.
- **Voting:** Either you or an automated system picks the winner of the debate!

## Features

- **Multi-AI Debate:** Integrates up to seven AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Cohere, LLaMA 2, Mistral) to provide diverse perspectives.
- **Custom Prompts:** Tailor-made instructions help each AI stay in character and deliver robust debate responses.
- **Real-Time Display:** See the debate happen live on a user-friendly React interface.
- **Voting System:** Decide which argument wins the debate.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Easily deploy the app on your home server or elsewhere.
