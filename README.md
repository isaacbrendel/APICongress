## What Is APICongress?

APICongress is a demo application that simulates a political debate by calling on several AI models. Here's how it works:
- **User Input:** You enter a debate topic.
- **AI Assignment:** The system assigns each AI a random political stance.
- **Debate Simulation:** Each AI responds with arguments reflecting its persona.
- **Voting:** Either you or an automated system picks the winner of the debate!
